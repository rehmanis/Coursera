# Project and Application Overviews
## Project #1: Degree Distribution for Graphs

* For your first project, you will write Python code that creates dictionaries corresponding to some simple examples of graphs. You will also implement two short functions that compute information about the distribution of the in-degrees for nodes in these graphs. You will then use these functions in the Application component of Module 1 where you will analyze the degree distribution of a citation graph for a collection of physics papers. This final portion of module will be peer assessed.

* We will use Python 2 in this class since OwlTest (the machine grader) supports Python 2. For more information on recommended Python IDEs, please consult this class page. Note that this portion of the module should be simple for experienced Python programmers. If you find it challenging, your Python skills may not be sufficient to be successful in this class.

## Application #1: Analysis of Citation Graphs

* In the Module 1 Application, we will combine the mathematical analysis that we began in the Homework with the code that you have written in the Project to analyze a real-world problem: How do scientific papers get cited? This part of the module will probably be much more unstructured than you are accustomed to in an on-line class. Our goal is to provide a more realistic simulation of how the concepts that you are learning are actually used in practice. Your key task in this part of the module is to think about the problem at hand as you answer each question.

* As part of this portion of the module, you'll need to write code that processes medium-sized datasets. You are welcome to use either desktop Python or CodeSkulptor when writing this code. To process the data in CodeSkulptor, you will need to be careful in how you implement your code and will probably need to increase the default timeout from 5 secs to around 20-30 secs.
