#Project and Application Overviews
##Project #3: Closest Pairs and Clustering Algorithm

* For the Project and Application portion of Module 3, you will implement and assess two methods for clustering data. For Project 3, you will also implement two methods for [computing closest pairs](https://storage.googleapis.com/codeskulptor-alg/pdf/ClosestPair.pdf) and [two methods for clustering data](https://storage.googleapis.com/codeskulptor-alg/pdf/Clustering.pdf). In Application 3, you will then compare these two clustering methods in terms of efficiency, automation, and quality. We suggest that you review [this handout](https://storage.googleapis.com/codeskulptor-alg/pdf/ClosestPairsAndClustering.pdf) with the pseudo-code for the methods that you will implement before your proceed.

##Application #3: Comparison of Clustering Algorithms

* In Project 3, you implemented two methods for clustering sets of data. In this Application, we will analyze the performance of these two methods on various subsets of our county-level cancer risk data set. In particular, we will compare these two clustering methods in three areas:

   * Efficiency - Which method computes clusterings more efficiently?
   * Automation - Which method requires less human supervision to generate reasonable clusterings?
   * Quality - Which method generates clusterings with less error?.
