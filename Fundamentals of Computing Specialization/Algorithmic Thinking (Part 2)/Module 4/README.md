#Project and Application Overviews
##Project #4: Computing Alignments of Sequences

* In Project 4, we will implement four functions. The first pair of functions will return matrices that we will use in computing the alignment of two sequences. The second pair of functions will return global and local alignments of two input sequences based on a provided alignment matrix. You will then use these functions in Application 4 to analyze two problems involving comparison of similar sequences.

##Application #4: Applications to Genomics and Beyond

* In Project 4, you implemented dynamic programming algorithms for determining both global and local alignments of pairs of sequences. In this Application, we will demonstrate the utility of these algorithms in two domains. In the first part of the Application, we examine an interesting problem from genomics. (This is based on "Introduction to Computational Genomics", by Nello Cristianini and Matthew W. Hahn). We will compare two sequences that have diverged from a common ancestor sequence due to mutation. (Mutation here includes base-pair substitution, which changes the sequence content, and insertion/deletion, which change the sequence lengths.) In the second part of the Application, we consider words that have spelling mistakes.

For the genomics part of the Application, you will load several protein sequences and an appropriate scoring matrix. For the spelling correction part of the Application, you will load a provided word list. To simplify these tasks, you are welcome to use this [provided code](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#alg_application4_provided.py).
