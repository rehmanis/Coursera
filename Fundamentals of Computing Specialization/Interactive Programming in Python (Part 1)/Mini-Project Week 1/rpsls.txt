Min-Project #1 Overview:
-Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (RPSLS) is a variant of Rock-paper-scissors that allows five 
 choices. Each choice wins against two other choices, loses against two other choices and ties 
 against itself. Much of RPSLS's popularity is that it has been featured in 3 episodes of the 
 TV series "The Big Bang Theory". The Wikipedia entry for RPSLS gives the complete description 
 of the details of the game.

-In our first mini-project, we will build a Python function rpsls(name) that takes as input 
 the string name, which is one of "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", or "Spock". The function 
 then simulates playing a round of Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock by generating its own random 
 choice from these alternatives and then determining the winner using a simple rule that we will 
 next describe.

-While Rock-paper-scissor-lizard-Spock has a set of ten rules that logically determine who wins 
 a round of RPSLS, coding up these rules would require a large number (5x5=25) of if/elif/else 
 clauses in your mini-project code. A simpler method for determining the winner is to assign each 
 of the five choices a number:
  0 — rock
  1 — Spock
  2 — paper
  3 — lizard
  4 — scissors

-In this expanded list, each choice wins against the preceding two choices and loses against the 
 following two choices (if rock and scissors are thought of as being adjacent using modular arithmetic).
