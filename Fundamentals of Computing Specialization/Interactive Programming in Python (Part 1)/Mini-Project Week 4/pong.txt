Min-Project #4 Overview:
-In this project, we will build a version of Pong, one of the first arcade video games (1972). 
 While Pong is not particularly exciting compared to today's video games, Pong is relatively 
 simple to build and provides a nice opportunity to work on the skills that you will need to 
 build a game like Asteroids.
