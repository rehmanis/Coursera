# Mini-project #3 - "StopWatch: The Game"

Implemented the game that using Timers in CodeSkulptor, a browser-based Python interpreter, as part of the coursework. To play the game go [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user46_Kwifo40s54_7.py) and press the play button on the top left corner. A pop up window will appear and allow you start, stop, or reset the timer. The goal of the game is to stop the timer on a whole number. The number of correctly stopped timer attempts vs. the total number of attempts to stop the timer on whole number are printed on the top right corner of the window.

* Our mini-project for this week will focus on combining text drawing in the canvas with timers to build a simple digital stopwatch that keeps track of the time in tenths of a second. The stopwatch should contain "Start", "Stop" and "Reset" buttons.
