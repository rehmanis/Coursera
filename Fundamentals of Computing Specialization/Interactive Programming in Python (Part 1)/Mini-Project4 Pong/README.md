# Mini-project #4 - Pong

Implemented a simple pong game in CodeSkulptor, a browser-based Python interpreter, as part of the cousrework. To play the game go [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user46_oYvhasFKzo_1.py) and press the play button on the top left corner. To control the pong pad, use the up and down arrow keys for the right player and "w" and "s" keys for the left player. As the game progresses without any player losing a point, the speed of the ball will increase to make the game more fun to play.

Mini-project overview taken from course page can be found below:
* "In this project, we will build a version of Pong, one of the first arcade video games (1972). While Pong is not particularly exciting compared to today's video games, Pong is relatively simple to build and provides a nice opportunity to work on the skills that you will need to build a game like Asteroids. As usual, we have provided a [program template](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#examples-pong_template.py) that can be used to guide your development of Pong."
