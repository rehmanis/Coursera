Min-Project #5 Overview:
-Memory is a card game in which the player deals out a set of cards face down. In Memory, a 
 turn (or a move) consists of the player flipping over two cards. If they match, the player 
 leaves them face up. If they don't match, the player flips the cards back face down. The 
 goal of Memory is to end up with all of the cards flipped face up in the minimum number 
 of turns. For this project, we will keep our model for Memory fairly simple. A Memory deck 
 consists of eight pairs of matching cards.
