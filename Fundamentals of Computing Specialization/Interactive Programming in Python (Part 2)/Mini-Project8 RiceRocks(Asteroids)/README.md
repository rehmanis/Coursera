# Mini-project #8 - RiceRocks

Overview
* For our last mini-project, we will complete the implementation of RiceRocks, an updated version of Asteroids, that we began last week. You should add the splash screen image that you dismiss with a mouse click before starting this mini-project. We strongly recommend using Chrome for this mini-project since Chrome's superior performance will become apparent when your program attempts to draw dozens of sprites.
