# Mini-project #8 - RiceRocks

Implemented a simple version of the classic arcade game Asteroids in CodeSkulptor, a browser-based Python interpreter, as part of the coursework. To play the game go [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user46_dzLwwfibjR_8.py) and press the play button on the top left corner. A window will pop up and will require the clicking it to start the game. 
Turn on the volume to hear the game music and sounds. To navigate the spaceship use the arrow keys and to fire missiles use the spacebar. As the game progresses, the speed of rocks spawning will increase to make the game more competitive

Mini-project overview taken from course page can be found below:
* For our last mini-project, we will complete the implementation of RiceRocks, an updated version of Asteroids, that we began last week. You should add the splash screen image that you dismiss with a mouse click before starting this mini-project. We strongly recommend using Chrome for this mini-project since Chrome's superior performance will become apparent when your program attempts to draw dozens of sprites.
