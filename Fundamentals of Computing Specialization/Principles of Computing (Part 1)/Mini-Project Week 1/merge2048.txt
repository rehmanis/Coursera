Min-Project #1 Overview:
-2048 is a simple grid-based numbers game. The object of the game is to combine tiles with the same 
 number to make larger numbered tiles. You "win" when you create a 2048 tile. In the first two 
 assignments, we will implement a version of the 2048 game. Although the original game is played on 
 a 4 x 4 grid, your version should be able to have an arbitrary height and width. In this first assignment,
 we will focus on only one aspect of the game: merging tiles.
