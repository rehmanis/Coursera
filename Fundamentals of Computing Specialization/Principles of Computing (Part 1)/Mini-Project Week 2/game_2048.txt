Min-Project #2 Overview:
-For this assignment, your task is to complete the implementation of a version of the 2048 game. 
 Since we will provide a graphical user interface for the game, your task is to implement the game 
 logic in terms of a TwentyFortyEight class in Python. Although the original game is played on a 
 4×4 grid, your version should be able to have an arbitrary height and width.

-We have provided the following template that contains an outline of the TwentyFortyEight class. 
 The signature (name and parameters) of the functions, classes, and methods in this file must remain 
 unchanged, but you may add any additional functions, methods, or other code that you need to.
