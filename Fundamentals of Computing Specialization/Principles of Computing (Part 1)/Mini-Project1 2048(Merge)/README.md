# Mini-project #1 - 2048(Merge)

Overview
* 2048 is a simple grid-based numbers game. The object of the game is to combine tiles with the same number to make larger numbered tiles. You "win" when you create a 2048 tile. In the first two assignments, we will implement a version of the 2048 game. Although the original game is played on a <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=4&space;\times&space;4" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?4&space;\times&space;4" title="4 \times 4" /></a> grid, your version should be able to have an arbitrary height and width. In this first assignment,we will focus on only one aspect of the game: merging tiles.

* We have provided the following [template](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#poc_2048_merge_template.py) that contains the basic code that you will need to implement the merge function. The signature (name and parameters) of the functions in this file must remain unchanged, but you may add any additional functions or other code that you need to.
