# Mini-project #2 - 2048(Full)

Implemented the 2048 game logic in CodeSkulptor, a browser-based Python interpreter, as part of the coursework. To play the game go [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user46_iYjoTGs3rX_51.py) and press the play button on the top left corner. 

Mini-project overview taken from course page can be found below:
* For this assignment, your task is to complete the implementation of a version of the 2048 game. Since we will provide a graphical user interface for the game, your task is to implement the game logic in terms of a **TwentyFortyEight** class in Python. Although the original game is played on a <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=4&space;\times&space;4" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?4&space;\times&space;4" title="4 \times 4" /></a> grid, your version should be able to have an arbitrary height and width.

* We have provided the following [template](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#poc_2048_template.py) that contains an outline of the **TwentyFortyEight** class. The signature (name and parameters) of the functions, classes, and methods in this file must remain unchanged, but you may add any additional functions, methods, or other code that you need to.
