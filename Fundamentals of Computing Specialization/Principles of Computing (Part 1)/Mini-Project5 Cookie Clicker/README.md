# Mini-project #5 - Cookie Clicker

Overview
* Cookie Clicker is a game built around a simulation in which your goal is to bake as many cookies as fast as possible. The main strategy component of the game is choosing how to allocate the cookies that you have produced to upgrade your ability to produce even more cookies faster. You can play Cookie Clicker [here](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). Before you start work on this mini-project, we strongly recommend that you complete the Practice Activity, ["The Case of the Greedy Boss"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-1/supplement/b8bvB/practice-activity-the-case-of-the-greedy-boss), which is designed to walk you through the steps of building a simulation similar to Cookie Clicker.

* In Cookie Clicker, you have many options for upgrading your ability to produce cookies. Originally, you can only produce cookies by clicking your mouse. However, you can use the cookies you earn to buy other methods of producing cookies (Grandmas, farms, factories, etc.). Each production method increases the number of "cookies per second" (CPS) you produce. Further, each time you buy one of the production methods, its price goes up. So, you must carefully consider the cost and benefits of purchasing a production method, and the trade-offs change as the game goes on.

* For this assignment, you will implement a simplified simulation of the Cookie Clicker game. You will implement different strategies and see how they fare over a given period of time. In our version of the game, there is no graphical interface and therefore no actual "clicking". Instead, you will start with a CPS of 1.0 and may start purchasing automatic production methods once you have enough cookies to do so. You will implement both the simulation engine for the game and your own strategies for selecting what production methods to buy.

* We have provided the following [template](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#poc_clicker_template.py) that contains an outline of the code you will write, including a **ClickerState** class, which will keep track of the state of the simulation, and a **simulate_clicker** function, which will run the simulation. The signature (name and parameters) of the functions, classes, and methods in this file must remain unchanged, but you may add any additional functions, methods, or other code that you need to.
