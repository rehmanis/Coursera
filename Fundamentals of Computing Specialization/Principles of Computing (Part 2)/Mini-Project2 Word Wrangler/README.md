# Mini-project #2 Word Wrangler

Implemented the game logic and other helper functions for Word Wrangler game in CodeSkulptor, a browser-based Python interpreter, as part of the coursework. To play the game, click [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user46_5gpKzUvHYk_75.py) and press the play button on the top left corner. A window will pop up. The game can then be played by typing in a new word and based on the letters of this word, other words are be guessed.

Mini-project overview taken from course page can be found below:
* In this mini-project we will create a simple word game. The game will take an input word and then generate all valid words that can be created using the letters in the input word. You will then play the game by guessing all of the words. The objective of this mini-project is to work with ordered lists and recursion. While it is possible to write the functions in other ways, we strongly encourage you to follow the spirit of the mini-project. The only way to become more comfortable with recursion is to write recursive functions!

* We have provided a working GUI and a class to manage the state of the game. You will be responsible for writing several helper functions. These functions will be used by the provided code in order to build the list of valid words that are composed of letters from the input word.
