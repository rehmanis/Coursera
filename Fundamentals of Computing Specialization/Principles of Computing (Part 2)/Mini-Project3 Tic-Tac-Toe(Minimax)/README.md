# Mini-project #3 Tic-Tac-Toe(Minimax)

Overview
* We have previously seen Tic-Tac-Toe in part 1 of this class. In this assignment, we are going to revisit the game and develop an alternative strategy to play the game.

* For this assignment, your task is to implement a machine player for Tic-Tac-Toe that uses a Minimax strategy to decide its next move. You will be able to use the same console-based interface and graphical user interface to play the game as you did before. Although the game is played on <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=3&space;\times&space;3" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?3&space;\times&space;3" title="3 \times 3" /></a> grid, your version should be able to handle any square grid (however, the time it will take to search the tree for larger grid sizes will be prohibitively slow). We will continue to use the same [grid conventions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-2/supplement/2DOSk/math-notes-on-grid-representations) that we have used previously.

* This project does not require you to write a lot of code. It does, however, bring together a lot of concepts that we have previously seen in the class. We would like you to think about how these concepts are coming together to enable you to build a relatively complex machine player with very little code. Further, you should think about the situations in which Minimax or Monte Carlo might produce better/worse machine players for games other than Tic-Tac-Toe.
