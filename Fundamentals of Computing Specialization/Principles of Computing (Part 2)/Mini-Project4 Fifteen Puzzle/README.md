# Mini-project #4 Fifteen Puzzles

Overview:

This week's homework introduced you to the Fifteen puzzle and outlined the highlights of building a solver for the puzzle. As described in the homework, the solution process for a puzzle of size <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=m&space;\times&space;n" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m&space;\times&space;n" title="m \times n" /></a> has three phases:

1. Solve the bottom m-2 rows of the puzzle in a row by row manner from bottom to top. Each individual row will be solved in a right to left order.
2. Solve the rightmost n-2 columns of the top two rows of the puzzle (in a right to left order). Each column consists of two unsolved positions and will be solved in a bottom to top order.
3. Solve the upper left <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=2&space;\times&space;2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2&space;\times&space;2" title="2 \times 2" /></a> portion of the puzzle directly.
